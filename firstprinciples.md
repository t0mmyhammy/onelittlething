# Troubleshooting First Principles

## Core Philosophy

**STOP. THINK. UNDERSTAND. THEN ACT.**

Every bug fix should follow this systematic approach. Rushing to "fix" things creates more problems than it solves.

---

## The First Principles Framework

### 1. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM (Before Any Code)

#### Ask These Questions First:
- ❓ **What is the actual problem?** (Not symptoms, the real issue)
- ❓ **What was the expected behavior?**
- ❓ **What is the current behavior?**
- ❓ **When did this start happening?** (What changed?)
- ❓ **Can I reproduce it reliably?**
- ❓ **What environment?** (Local, staging, production?)

#### Gather Complete Information:
```bash
# Don't assume - verify everything
✅ Check logs (backend.log, scheduler.log)
✅ Check database state (actual data, not assumptions)
✅ Check API responses (curl the actual endpoint)
✅ Check recent commits (git log --oneline -10)
✅ Check deployment status (Railway/Vercel logs)
```

**🚫 NEVER skip this step to start coding faster.**

---

### 2. IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE (Not Symptoms)

#### The "5 Whys" Technique:

**Example: "Last scrape timestamp not showing"**

1. **Why?** → API returns `null` for `last_updated`
2. **Why?** → No trades in database today
3. **Why?** → Query only returns timestamp if trades exist
4. **Why?** → We're querying the trades table, not scrape attempts
5. **Root Cause:** No dedicated table to track scrape attempts

**Wrong approach:** "Add a marker trade to the trades table" (treats symptom)
**Right approach:** "Create a scrape_logs table" (solves root cause)

#### Red Flags of Treating Symptoms:
- 🚩 Adding special case handling (`if marker != "_MARKER_"`)
- 🚩 Filtering out fake data in queries
- 🚩 Using magic strings or constants
- 🚩 Comments that say "workaround" or "hack"
- 🚩 Solution makes the codebase more complex

---

### 3. DESIGN THE COMPLETE SOLUTION

#### Before Writing ANY Code:

**A. Consider All Constraints:**
```yaml
Database:
  - Column size limits (VARCHAR lengths)
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Unique constraints
  - Performance implications

Deployment:
  - Will migrations run automatically?
  - What happens on rollback?
  - Different databases (SQLite local, PostgreSQL prod)?
  - Environment variables needed?

Code:
  - TypeScript/Python type safety
  - API contract changes
  - Backward compatibility
  - Error handling
```

**B. Ask: "What Could Go Wrong?"**
- What if database is empty?
- What if migration fails?
- What if old data exists?
- What if API call times out?
- What if user has no permissions?

**C. Design for Scalability:**
```
❌ BAD: Quick fix that creates tech debt
✅ GOOD: Proper architecture that's maintainable

Example:
❌ Add marker records to trades table
   - Pollutes data
   - Requires filtering everywhere
   - Fragile and error-prone

✅ Create dedicated scrape_logs table
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy to query
   - Can add metadata later
   - No special cases needed
```

---

### 4. VALIDATE THE APPROACH

#### Before Implementing:

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does this solve the root cause? (Not just symptoms)
- [ ] Is this the simplest solution? (Occam's Razor)
- [ ] Will this work in all environments? (Local, staging, prod)
- [ ] Does this create technical debt?
- [ ] Can this be extended later?
- [ ] Are there existing patterns in the codebase to follow?

**Ask Clarifying Questions:**
```
Instead of assuming:
❓ "Should timestamps be in UTC or PT?"
❓ "Do we need to track scrape failures?"
❓ "What's the retention policy for logs?"
❓ "How will this scale with more scrape types?"
```

---

### 5. IMPLEMENT SYSTEMATICALLY

#### Development Order:

**A. Data Layer First:**
```python
1. Database schema/models
2. Migration scripts
3. Test migration locally
```

**B. Backend Logic:**
```python
4. Update scraper to log attempts
5. Update API to read from new source
6. Add error handling
7. Test locally with curl
```

**C. Frontend:**
```typescript
8. Update API calls
9. Update UI display
10. Test in browser
```

**D. Deployment:**
```bash
11. Ensure migrations run on deployment
12. Test in staging (if available)
13. Deploy to production
14. Verify with real API calls
```

**🚫 NEVER deploy all changes at once without testing each layer.**

---

### 6. TEST THOROUGHLY

#### Test Matrix:

```
Environment | Database | Expected Behavior
------------|----------|------------------
Local       | SQLite   | ✅ Tables created, data correct
Local       | Empty DB | ✅ Migration runs, no errors
Production  | PostgreSQL | ✅ Auto-migration on startup
Production  | Existing data | ✅ Backward compatible
```

#### Edge Cases to Always Test:
- Empty database
- Missing environment variables
- Network failures
- Timezone differences (UTC vs PT)
- Large datasets
- Old/stale data

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The "Quick Fix" Trap
```python
# ❌ BAD: Quick hack
if trade_number == "_MARKER_":
    continue  # Skip fake marker

# ✅ GOOD: Proper solution
# Use dedicated scrape_logs table
```

### 2. The "It Works On My Machine"
```bash
# ❌ BAD: Only testing locally
$ python test_locally.py
# Looks good! Deploy!

# ✅ GOOD: Test deployment flow
$ # Test with production database
$ # Test migration scripts
$ # Test environment variables
$ # Test error scenarios
```

### 3. The "Assume It Will Work"
```python
# ❌ BAD: Assuming migration runs
# Just push code that needs new table

# ✅ GOOD: Ensure migration runs
# Add migration to app startup
# Test in staging first
# Verify table exists before using
```

### 4. The "Patch Over Patch"
```python
# ❌ BAD: Fixing symptoms repeatedly
v1: Add marker record
v2: Fix marker length issue
v3: Clean up old markers
v4: Fix count issue with markers

# ✅ GOOD: Fix root cause once
v1: Create scrape_logs table
# No more patches needed
```

## Real-World Example: Value-Trades Timestamp Issue

### ❌ What Went Wrong:

```
1. Problem: "Last scrape" not showing
   ↓
2. Quick fix: Add marker trade
   ↓
3. Issue: Marker too long for VARCHAR(10)
   ↓
4. Patch: Shorten marker
   ↓
5. Issue: Table doesn't exist in prod
   ↓
6. Patch: Add auto-migration
   ↓
7. Issue: Old markers still in database
   ↓
8. Patch: Add cleanup code
   ↓
9. Issue: Wrong timezone
   ↓
10. Patch: Add timezone conversion
```

**Result:** 10 commits, 3 deployments, multiple bugs

### ✅ What Should Have Happened:

```
1. Problem: "Last scrape" not showing
   ↓
2. Root cause analysis:
   - Need to track scrape attempts
   - Trades table is wrong place
   ↓
3. Complete solution design:
   - Create scrape_logs table
   - Track all attempts (success/failure)
   - Store in UTC, display in PT
   - Auto-migration on startup
   - Test locally and in prod
   ↓
4. One implementation, one deployment
```

**Result:** 1 commit, 1 deployment, clean solution

## Decision-Making Framework

### When Faced With a Problem:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Can I fix root cause in <30 min?  │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────┘
              │
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        │    YES    │
        └─────┬─────┘
              │
    ┌─────────▼──────────┐
    │ Design complete    │
    │ solution properly  │
    └─────────┬──────────┘
              │
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        │    NO     │
        └─────┬─────┘
              │
    ┌─────────▼──────────┐
    │ Break into phases  │
    │ or ask for help    │
    └────────────────────┘
```

### Red Flags to STOP and Rethink:

- 🚩 "I'll just add a quick check here..."
- 🚩 "This is a temporary workaround..."
- 🚩 "I'll fix it properly later..."
- 🚩 "It works, I don't know why..."
- 🚩 "Let me try this and see what happens..."

### Green Flags to Proceed:

- ✅ "I understand why this happens..."
- ✅ "This solves the root cause..."
- ✅ "This is maintainable long-term..."
- ✅ "I've tested all edge cases..."
- ✅ "This follows existing patterns..."

## Questions to Ask Before EVERY Fix

### The Fundamental Questions:

1. **Do I fully understand the problem?**
   - If no → Gather more information

2. **Do I know the root cause?**
   - If no → Do deeper analysis

3. **Is this the simplest solution?**
   - If no → Find simpler approach

4. **Will this create new problems?**
   - If yes → Redesign solution

5. **Can I test this completely?**
   - If no → Break into smaller pieces

6. **Is this maintainable?**
   - If no → Choose different approach

## Summary: The Golden Rules

### 🥇 Rule #1: Understand Before Acting
**Never write code without understanding the root cause.**

### 🥇 Rule #2: Design Complete Solutions
**Fix the problem, not the symptoms.**

### 🥇 Rule #3: Consider All Implications
**Think through deployment, edge cases, and scalability.**

### 🥇 Rule #4: Test Thoroughly
**Verify the complete flow, not just happy path.**

### 🥇 Rule #5: Document Your Reasoning
**Future you (or others) need to understand why.**

## When In Doubt

**STOP. ASK. CLARIFY.**

It's always better to:
- ✅ Ask a clarifying question
- ✅ Take time to design properly
- ✅ Admit you don't know something
- ✅ Request help on complex issues

Than to:
- ❌ Rush to a quick fix
- ❌ Assume you understand
- ❌ Create technical debt
- ❌ Deploy broken code

---

**Remember: The fastest way to solve a problem is to solve it correctly the first time.**
